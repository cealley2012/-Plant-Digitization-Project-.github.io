## Introduction

This project is being developed to standardize and simplify collecting and processing natural history specimens. It is a collaboration project designed and developed by UTC students. This code is intended to be used in tandem with an android mobile field app which is currently in early testing. The user interface has been adapted from pandastable by Damien Farrell. The mobile application was developed through MIT's App inventor II.

## The Importance of Modernizing Field Collection Techniques
The collection of biological specimens is essential to conservation and scientific research.  The wealth of information gained from these collections are used in a wide array of scientific research including the determination of new species, the delination of suitable habitats for vulnerable species, and predicting the negative effects of climate change on sensitive organisms.

The current workflow for collections involves recording information about the specimen in the field to later be input into a computer for label printing.  Those labels are then transcribed online for database entry.  The concern with the current workflow is that is provides users with two seperate opportunities to make mistakes in data entry.  The first opportunity being when labels are initially transcribed, and the second being when labels are transcribed to be uploaded to databases. This creates a situation similar to the childhood game of telephone that, as we all know, results in the accumulation of errors and produces a product that is unique to the original.

The purpose of this project is to standardize collections with an app designed to collect data in the field and a desktop program designed to create labels and have information that is ready to upload to a database.  This app will eliminate one transcription step and reduce the amount of errors in online databases containing natural history collections.
